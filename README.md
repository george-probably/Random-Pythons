# Random Pythons
I'll be honest, I have a load of **really bad** python programmes I wrote years ago, instead of having them just decaying away in my Google Drive, I thought it would be funny to just have them here. An important note: most of this was written when I was like 15, so however low you think your expectations are, lower it 3 more steps.

In case you're curious about my development in Python, each of the files *should* have a date-stamp at the top, so you can see roughly how long I had been coding for when I wrote them. Also - I had no concept of version control, it was all just written directly over itself, mostly using Notepad++. Remember kids: Do as I say, not as I do.
